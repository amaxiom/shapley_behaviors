### Tommy Liu
**Role:** Co-Developer, Algorithm Implementation  
**GitHub:** [@uilymmot](https://github.com/uilymmot)  
**Contributions:**
- Core Shapley value computation algorithms
- Parallel processing implementation
- Categorical and continuous label handling
- Performance optimization

## Methodology Attribution

The Shapley behavioral transformation approach is based on:

**Liu, T. & Barnard, A.S.** (2025). "Shapley-Based Feature Engineering for Materials Science." *Machine Learning: Engineering* (in press).

This toolkit extends that methodology with:
- User-defined region analysis
- Mixed label type support (continuous + categorical)
- Validation framework (original vs behavioral space comparisons)
- Production-ready tools for materials informatics
